# [Who's that Pokemon?] Proposal

## What is [name of game]?
The name of the game is: Who's that Pokemon?

(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)

Ever wonder if you're worthy of calling yourself a Pokemon Master? Well, you'll find out here after playing Who's that Pokemon. You'll test your skills in guessing the Pokemon's name after seeing their silhouette and beat that timer on the screen. Good Luck!

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
Some things that I've encountered in my game:

1. Try to reset my time after submitting the correct answer. 
->Selected my class timer and declared it in event listener function.

2. Ending the timer and the next image once the images runs out.
->SetTimeout

3. Able to reset timer in the second gen.

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

1. Complete wireframes
2. Collect assets (images/or audio)
3. Coding
  a. Timer
  b. Slide images
  c. Submit button that changes current image
  d. End slide images
  e. Prompt User corresponding messages

MVP
Need to be able to guess pokemon and match the images,
show timer for countdown,
needs the submit button to work for the next image to be displayed,
need to show user a prompt corresponding to their invisible score set in the code,
show a button that they can play again.
