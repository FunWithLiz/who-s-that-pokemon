## What is Who's that Pokemon?

Ever wonder if you're worthy of calling yourself a Pokemon Master? Well, YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PAGE. Because you'll be testing your skills in guessing the Pokemon's name after seeing their silhouette. You'll also need to beat the timer on the screen before it switches to the next image. How many Pokemon can you guess? Good Luck!

## Technical Discussion
### HTML
Didn't use that much HTML in game other than using the input value to move on to the next image.
### CSS
Used a lot of CSS to style the buttons to match the Pokemon Logo.
### JavaScript
Made several JS files and linked it with my two HTML files I made for this game.


## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
Some things that I've encountered in my game:

1. Try to reset my time after submitting the correct answer. 
->Selected my class timer and declared it in event listener function.

2. Ending the timer and the next image once the images runs out.
->SetTimeout

3. Able to reset timer in the second gen.

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

1. Complete wireframes
2. Collect assets (images/or audio)
3. Coding
  a. Timer
  b. Slide images
  c. Submit button that changes current image
  d. End slide images
  e. Prompt User corresponding messages
